I‚Äôm **Juliana @acostauribe** and am a results-driven researcher with a strong background in neurogenetic research, bioinformatics, and collaborative projects. With dual degrees, an M.D. and a Ph.D. in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. I am committed to making significant contributions to the field of neurodegenerative diseases.

üîç Current Role:
As an Assistant Researcher at the Neuroscience Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, I am immersed in cutting-edge research aimed at unraveling the complex genetics behind Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. My work focuses on analyzing intricate genetic data from Latin American populations and collaborating with multi-disciplinary teams to drive impactful outcomes.

üí° Mentorship and Community Involvement:
Beyond my research, I am a dedicated mentor and actively contribute to academic and professional communities. My involvement in various organizations, and leading the Computational Genetics training for the Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America (ReD-Lat), underscores my commitment to collaborative progress.

I am excited about connecting with fellow researchers, professionals, and individuals who share a passion for coding and unraveling the mysteries of neurodegeneration and making a meaningful difference. Let's collaborate, innovate, build capacity and drive positive change together!
