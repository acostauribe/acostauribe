I‚Äôm Juliana @acostauribe am a results-driven researcher with a strong background in neurogenetic research, bioinformatics, and collaborative projects. With dual degrees‚Äîan M.D. and a Ph.D. in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. I am committed to making significant contributions to the field of neurodegenerative diseases.

üîç Current Role:
As an Assistant Researcher at the Neuroscience Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, I am immersed in cutting-edge research aimed at unraveling the complex genetics behind Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. My work focuses on analyzing intricate genetic data from Latin American populations and collaborating with multi-disciplinary teams to drive impactful outcomes.

üî¨ Research Excellence:
I have pioneered genetic analyses of Latin-American cases and families with neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to studies that provide novel insights into Alzheimer's disease. My expertise spans genetic variant curation, association studies, and the application of innovative computational tools to decipher the genetic underpinnings of these conditions.

üí° Mentorship and Community Involvement:
Beyond my research, I am a dedicated mentor and actively contribute to academic and professional communities. I have guided and mentored aspiring researchers, fostering their growth and success. My involvement in various organizations, including the Computational Genetics training for the Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America (ReD-Lat), underscores my commitment to collaborative progress.

I am excited about connecting with fellow researchers, professionals, and individuals who share a passion for coding and unraveling the mysteries of neurodegeneration and making a meaningful difference. Let's collaborate, innovate, build capacity and drive positive change together!
